	<h1><code>/inc/MODEL</code> folder</h1>
	<p>This folder holds the Data <strong>Model</strong> for the application.</p>
<p>The Data Model is the translation of the &quot;real world&quot; data into how this data is processed in the computer memory. In other words, it is also a PHP representation of the SQL DBMS data.</p>
<p>There will typically be one PHP Class for each DB table. Each object (instance of that class) roughly maps to a row in the table. Of course the Class may/should implement more integrity rules than the DB table alone.</p>
<p>There may also typically be one PHP Cacheing Object/Class (a Class with a single instance actually) for many tables in the DB. The Cache object will optimize accesses the DB by avoiding repeated queries on the same data.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Data Model may also include data manipulation functions that do not take the form of a class.</p>
