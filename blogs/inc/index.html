	<h1><code>/inc</code> folder</h1>
	<p>This folder holds the <strong>inc</strong>ludes needed by the main PHP entry points.</p>
	<p><em>This is a PHP includes folder. It does not need to be accessed through the web.</em></p>
	<p>The architecture of this folder is MVC based. This means that the bulk of the include files are separated into 3 main categories: Model, View and Controller. </p>
	<p>Additional includes are places into the <code>_misc</code> subfolder. </p>
<p>This folder also holds the <code>_main.inc.php</code> file which handle the main initializations for the application.</p>
