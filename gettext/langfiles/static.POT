msgstr ""

msgid "Of course you can change this later when you are comfortable with b2evolution. By then, you will probably want to upload just the contents of your &quot;blogs&quot; folder, so your blogs can be accessed directly through http://www.yoursite.com or http://www.yoursite.com/blog_a.php..."

msgstr ""

msgid "Unless you changed the config, all tables created by b2evolution are prefixed with evo_ . Unless you already have an application using the same prefix, this makes it safe to install b2evolution in a database shared with other applications. For example, Cafelog/b2 used tables prefixed with b2 . Your existing tables will not be affected in any way."

msgid "Redo your configuration in the /conf folder as you did previously. As always, the only requirement is to edit _config.php.

msgid "You can keep your<strong> skins, blog templates and stubfiles for your blogs</strong>. However, now may be a good time to back them up ;) You should also backup your database if you can."

msgstr ""

msgid "The upgrade procedure below has been tested exclusively with b2 versions 0.6.1 and 0.6.2. Though, I think versions 0.5.x should also upgrade without problems. Anyway, if you run any old version of b2, you can give it a try quite safely. b2evolution will not harm your data, even if it can't understand it. The worst you would get is an error message."
msgstr ""

msgid "However, as always, it is wise to do a backup of your current website / blog / database (depending on what you already have) before starting to install something new."

msgid "On your server, locate the mysql database you are already using for Cafelog/b2. You must use the same database for b2evolution to be able to upgrade. Feel safe, b2evolution will not alter your Cafelog/b2 tables and data in any way!"
