		<h1>Upgrading from a previous version of b2evolution</h1>
		<p class="note">Before you begin, please note that some network features of b2evolution require you to agree our simple <a href="http://b2evolution.net/about/terms.html" target="_blank">Terms of service</a>.</p>
		<ol class="expanded">
			<li>Backup all your b2evolution files. Take special care of the files you may have modified, including /conf, skins, blog templates, stubfiles, hacks, third party plugins, etc...</li>
			<li>You should also backup your database if you can. This functionality should be provided by your host.</li>
			<li>Delete <strong>all your existing b2evolution files from your site</strong> before uploading the new ones! Some of the old files may not be compatible with this new version and will cause it to fail! This will also ensure you don't keep unnecessary files on your server after upgrading. Plus, it's better for security. </li>
		<li>Upload <strong>all new b2evolution files from the /blogs folder</strong> to your site. We cannot stress this enough: <strong>ALL FILES</strong>! And that means you can't reuse your customized files, including  /conf, skins, blog templates, stubfiles, etc. as they are!<br />
		<br />
		That means you will have to customize all these files again. We're sorry but, due to the pace of development and adding of new features, we cannot guarantee that anything will work if you keep older files in place. <strong>However</strong>, since you have backed up all these files in step 1, you can try to partially reuse them once the upgrade process is done. See step 8 below.</li>
			<li>Run the installation script on your server. It is located in <code>http://yoursite.com/yourblogsfolder/install</code> . Then, simply follow the on screen instructions.<br />
		<br />
		The installer will ask you basic configuration settings (unless you have already updated /conf/_config.php before uploading), then allow you to run a database upgrade from any b2evolution version to the new one.</li>
			<li>Check to make sure the new installation works.</li>
			<li>Check the online manual for <a href="http://manual.b2evolution.net/Upgrade_from_an_older_version" target="_blank">specific upgrade instructions</a> to your new version of b2evolution.</li>
			<li>On production servers, it is recommended that you delete the <code>/install</code> subfolder.</li>
			<li>It's now time to bring back your previous customizations.
		We recommend you get yourself a diff/merge tool like <a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">WinMerge</a>. This will allow you to easily compare your old (backuped) files with the new files (even whole directories at once) and report changes accordingly.</li>
